* **Numeric types:**
    * **int:** Integers (whole numbers) like 10, -5, 0.
    * **float:** Floating-point numbers (numbers with decimal points) like 3.14, -2.5.
    * **complex:** Complex numbers (numbers with real and imaginary parts) like 2+3j.
* **Text type:**
    * **str:** Strings, which are sequences of characters enclosed in single or double quotes, like ""Hello"" or 'world'.
* **Boolean type:**
    * **bool:** Represents truth values, either True or False.
* **Sequence types:**
    * **list:** Mutable ordered collections of items, allowing duplicates.
    * **tuple:** Immutable ordered collections of items, allowing duplicates.
* **Mapping type:**
    * **dict:** Key-value pairs, allowing fast lookups based on keys.
* **Set type:**
    * **set:** Unordered collections of unique items.

These data types allow you to represent and manipulate different kinds of information in your Python programs.
