127.0.0.1,generate a code to add two number,"```python
def add_numbers(num1, num2):
  """"""
  This function adds two numbers together.

  Args:
    num1: The first number.
    num2: The second number.

  Returns:
    The sum of the two numbers.
  """"""

  # Check if the inputs are valid numbers
  if not isinstance(num1, (int, float)) or not isinstance(num2, (int, float)):
    raise TypeError(""Inputs must be numbers."")

  # Calculate the sum
  sum = num1 + num2
  return sum

# Example usage
try:
  result = add_numbers(5, 3.14)
  print(f""The sum is: {result}"")
except TypeError as e:
  print(f""Error: {e}"")
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Function Definition:** The code defines a function called `add_numbers` that takes two arguments, `num1` and `num2`, representing the numbers to be added.
2. **Docstring:** The function includes a docstring that explains its purpose, input parameters, and return value. This is a crucial part of writing well-documented code.
3. **Type Checking:** The code uses `isinstance` to check if the input arguments are numbers (integers or floats). If not, it raises a `TypeError` to indicate that the inputs are invalid.
4. **Calculation:** The function calculates the sum of `num1` and `num2` and stores it in the `sum` variable.
5. **Return Value:** The function returns the calculated sum.
6. **Example Usage:** The code includes an example of how to use the `add_numbers` function. It tries to add 5 and 3.14, and prints the result. If there is a type error, it catches the exception and prints an error message.

This code demonstrates best practices by:

* Using a descriptive function name (`add_numbers`) and meaningful variable names (`num1`, `num2`, `sum`).
* Adhering to PEP 8 style guidelines (e.g., using spaces around operators).
* Including error handling to make the code robust.
* Defining a modular function to improve code organization.
