127.0.0.1,do you know what are variables,"In Python, a variable is like a named container that holds a value. You can think of it as a label you attach to a piece of data. For example:

```python
name = ""Alice""
age = 30
```

Here, `name` and `age` are variables. They store the values ""Alice"" and 30 respectively.  

You can use variables to store different types of data, like numbers, text, lists, or even more complex objects.
