What is Python?,"Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its easy-to-read syntax and dynamic typing."
What is PEP 8?,PEP 8 is the Python Enhancement Proposal which outlines the style guide for writing Python code.
What are Python decorators?,Decorators are a way to modify or enhance the behavior of functions or methods without changing their actual code.
Explain Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL).,"The GIL is a mutex that protects access to Python objects, preventing multiple threads from executing Python bytecode simultaneously."
What is the difference between a list and a tuple in Python?,"Lists are mutable, meaning they can be changed after creation, while tuples are immutable and cannot be altered."
What is a lambda function in Python?,A lambda function is an anonymous function expressed as a single statement.
What is the use of the 'self' keyword in Python?,'self' represents the instance of the class and is used to access variables and methods associated with the class.
Explain the concept of list comprehensions in Python.,List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists by iterating over an iterable and optionally applying a condition.
What are Python's built-in data types?,"Python's built-in data types include integers, floats, strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets."
What is the purpose of the 'pass' statement in Python?,The 'pass' statement is a null operation; it is used when a statement is syntactically required but you don't want to execute any code.
What is the difference between '==' and 'is' in Python?,"'==' checks for value equality, while 'is' checks for object identity."
Explain the use of the 'with' statement in Python.,The 'with' statement simplifies exception handling by encapsulating standard try-except-finally blocks in a reusable context.
What are generators in Python?,"Generators are iterators that produce items one at a time and only when required, using the 'yield' statement."
What is a Python module?,A module is a file containing Python definitions and statements intended for use in other Python programs.
What is the difference between Python 2 and Python 3?,"Python 3 introduced many new features and optimizations, including print as a function, integer division, and Unicode string by default."
Explain the concept of exception handling in Python.,Exception handling in Python uses the try-except block to catch and handle errors gracefully.
What is a Python package?,A package is a way of organizing related Python modules into a directory hierarchy.
What is the purpose of the '__init__.py' file?,'__init__.py' is used to mark a directory as a Python package and can include initialization code for the package.
What is the difference between a shallow copy and a deep copy?,"A shallow copy creates a new object but inserts references into it to the objects found in the original, while a deep copy creates a new object and recursively copies all objects found in the original."
What is a Python virtual environment?,A virtual environment is an isolated environment that allows you to manage dependencies separately from the global Python installation.
What is the use of the 'dir()' function?,'dir()' returns a list of attributes and methods belonging to an object or module.
What are *args and **kwargs in Python?,*args and **kwargs allow you to pass a variable number of arguments to a function.
Explain the concept of duck typing in Python.,"Duck typing is a concept in Python where the type or class of an object is less important than the methods it defines. If it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, itâ€™s treated as a duck."
What is the purpose of the 'super()' function?,"'super()' is used to call a method from the parent class in a subclass, particularly in the context of multiple inheritance."
What are list slicing and negative indexing?,"List slicing is used to extract parts of a list, while negative indexing allows you to access elements from the end of a list."
What is the purpose of the 'map()' function?,The 'map()' function applies a given function to all items in an input list.
What is the difference between 'return' and 'yield' in Python?,"'return' sends a value back to the caller and exits the function, while 'yield' returns a generator that can be iterated over."
Explain the use of Python's 'enumerate()' function.,"'enumerate()' adds a counter to an iterable and returns it as an enumerate object, which can be used in loops."
What is the use of the 'zip()' function?,'zip()' is used to combine two or more iterables into a single iterable of tuples.
What is a Python dictionary?,"A dictionary is an unordered collection of key-value pairs, where keys must be unique and immutable."
What is the purpose of the 'reduce()' function?,'reduce()' applies a rolling computation to sequential pairs of values in a list.
What is the use of Python's 'filter()' function?,'filter()' is used to create a list of elements for which a function returns true.
What is the difference between 'pop()' and 'remove()' methods in Python?,"'pop()' removes an element at a given index and returns it, while 'remove()' removes the first matching element (by value) and does not return it."
"What is the use of 'try', 'except', 'else', and 'finally' in Python?",These are used in exception handling to execute different blocks of code depending on whether an exception occurred.
What is the purpose of Python's 're' module?,The 're' module provides support for regular expressions in Python.
What are Python's 'iter()' and 'next()' functions?,"'iter()' returns an iterator object, and 'next()' retrieves the next item from the iterator."
"What is the difference between 'local', 'global', and 'nonlocal' variables?","Local variables are defined within a function, global variables are defined at the top-level of a script or module, and nonlocal variables are used in nested functions to refer to variables defined in the nearest enclosing scope."
What is the purpose of the 'assert' statement?,'assert' is used for debugging purposes; it tests a condition and triggers an error if the condition is false.
What is the difference between a method and a function in Python?,"A method is a function that is associated with an object, while a function is a standalone block of code that performs a specific task."
What is the 'None' keyword used for in Python?,'None' is a special constant in Python representing the absence of a value or a null value.
What are Python's 'staticmethod' and 'classmethod'?,"'staticmethod' defines a method that doesn't require access to the instance or class, while 'classmethod' requires a reference to the class object as the first parameter."
What is a list comprehension?,A list comprehension is a syntactic construct for creating a list based on existing iterables.
Explain Python's garbage collection mechanism.,Python's garbage collection mechanism automatically manages memory by deallocating objects that are no longer in use.
What is the difference between '==' and 'is' in Python?,"'==' checks if the values of two objects are equal, while 'is' checks if two objects are actually the same object in memory."
What is the purpose of the 'global' keyword in Python?,The 'global' keyword allows you to modify a variable outside of the current scope.
What is a Python generator?,A generator is a function that returns an iterator that yields a series of values one at a time.
What is the 'nonlocal' keyword used for in Python?,'nonlocal' is used in nested functions to indicate that a variable is not local to the function but is defined in an enclosing scope.
What is the difference between 'deepcopy' and 'shallowcopy'?,"A 'shallowcopy' creates a new object but inserts references into it to the objects found in the original, while a 'deepcopy' creates a new object and recursively copies all objects found in the original."
What is Python's 'set' data type?,A 'set' is an unordered collection of unique elements.
Explain the use of the 'del' statement.,"The 'del' statement is used to delete objects in Python, such as variables, list elements, or dictionary entries."
